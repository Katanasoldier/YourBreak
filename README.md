# Overview

</div>

## Why YourBreak?

Most timer apps lock you into rigid presets — **fixed work lengths, fixed break times, and a limited number of cycles.**  
That makes them simple, but not adaptable to how people actually work.

---

### ✨ What Makes YourBreak Different?
YourBreak allows you to create timers that fit ***you***.

- 🔲 **Add periods like blocks** to build your routine  
- 🕒 **Set the duration** for each block  
- 🎯 **Mix and match** work and breaks in any order you want  

> Example: `25m work → 5m break → 43m work → 2m rest`  
> YourBreak handles it all without restrictions.

### 🎯 Designed for Focus
The interface is built around one goal: **helping you stay focused.**  

- 🧘 **Clean & minimal** — only shows what you need in the moment  
- 🧭 **Effortless navigation** — two clear choices at a time, so decisions are easy and distraction-free
